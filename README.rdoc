# Members Only

A very simple Rails app that allows users to create posts that anyone can see, but only users who are logged in can see who a post was created by.

Includes:
* User signup
* User authentication
* User log in/out
* Views that change based on login status

Done as part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com).
